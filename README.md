# Border Intrusion Pattern Analysis using Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Border surveillance systems generate large volumes of movement data from sensors,
patrol logs, and monitoring infrastructure. Manual monitoring is inefficient and
reactive. This project aims to analyze spatio-temporal movement data to identify
potentially suspicious patterns and high-risk regions along border areas.

## Objectives
- Analyze spatial and temporal movement patterns
- Classify movement behavior as normal or potentially suspicious
- Identify high-risk border zones and time windows
- Generate risk scores to support early warning and prioritization

## Project Scope
- Uses simulated and publicly available datasets
- Does not rely on classified or sensitive data
- Focuses on pattern analysis and anomaly detection
- Emphasizes ethical and responsible ML usage

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- GeoPandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Folium
- Streamlit / Flask (for visualization)
